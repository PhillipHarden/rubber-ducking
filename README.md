Rubber Ducking? by Phillip Harden


Rubber ducking… just that phrase sounds silly. And then when you discover the meaning, it sounds even more absurd! Like how would talking to a rubber duck help you debug your code. Sounds like something that a crazy person came up with. Until you try it and find out for yourself that it works. Crazy right!? 

I figured out that it worked before I knew that there was a term to describe it. I seriously thought that I had just made it up myself. I would often get really frustrated when my code didn't do what I wanted it to do. So, I came up with a way to help me figure out what was wrong. I would read each line of code out loud and try to understand what it was doing. When that didn't work, I would take a break and explain to my wife in detail what I was trying to do, even though she didn't have a clue about any of my code references. But somehow, just talking about it would give me new ideas. I would then quickly go back to my computer and try out these new ideas, and majority of the time they worked. 

One day, I was telling a friend about this method I used to fix problems in my code. He responded, "Oh, you mean rubber ducking?" I laughed and asked him “what in the world is rubber ducking?”. He told me that “rubber ducking is when you talk to a rubber duck (or something similar) to figure out what's wrong with your code, lots of programmers do it”. I couldn’t believe there was a term for this, and I was happy to learn that other people also find this method helpful.

So, I do not actually have a rubber duck to use this method with. Instead, I talk to the cast of the 1985 film The Breakfast Club. Well not actually the cast, but a poster of them in my office. 

 

Yup… John Bender, Andrew Clark, Allison Reynolds, Brian Johnson, and Claire Standish all stare at me like they could not care less as I explain to them what each line of my code is doing, or not doing. And just about every time their cold stares trigger an idea that works or tells me what I am missing. And I happily end my conversation with a poster on my wall with thanks guys!
