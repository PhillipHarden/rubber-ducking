          Rubber ducking, just that phrase sounds silly. And then when you
          discover the meaning, it sounds even more absurd! Like how would
          talking to a rubber duck help you debug your code. Sounds like
          something that a crazy person came up with. Until you try it and find
          out for yourself that it works. Crazy right!?
        </p>

          I figured out that it worked before I knew that there was a term to
          describe it. I seriously thought that I had just made it up myself. I
          would often get really frustrated when my code didn't do what I wanted
          it to do. So, I came up with a way to help me figure out what was
          wrong. I would read each line of code out loud and try to understand
          what it was doing. When that didn't work, I would take a break and
          explain to my wife in detail what I was trying to do, even though she
          didn't have a clue about any of my code references. But somehow, just
          talking about it would give me new ideas. I would then quickly go back
          to my computer and try out these new ideas, and majority of the time
          they worked.

          One day, I was telling a friend about this method I used to fix
          problems in my code. He responded, "Oh, you mean rubber ducking?" I
          laughed and asked him “what in the world is rubber ducking?”. He told
          me that “rubber ducking is when you talk to a rubber duck (or
          something similar) to figure out what's wrong with your code, lots of
          programmers do it”. I couldn’t believe there was a term for this, and
          I was happy to learn that other people also find this method helpful.

          So, I do not actually have a rubber duck to use this method with.
          Instead, I talk to the cast of the 1985 film The Breakfast Club. Well
          not actually the cast, but a poster of them in my office.

          Yup… John Bender, Andrew Clark, Allison Reynolds, Brian Johnson, and
          Claire Standish all stare at me like they could not care less as I
          explain to them what each line of my code is doing, or not doing. And
          just about every time their cold stares trigger an idea that works or
          tells me what I am missing. And I happily end my conversation with a
          poster on my wall with thanks guys!
